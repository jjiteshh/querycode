# QueryCode: GPT-4 Plugin
## Description
QueryCode is a powerful tool that allows GPT-4 to interact with your local codebase directly. It provides features for code exploration, debugging, and a memory feature for storing and retrieving important information about your codebase.

When integrated with AI models like GPT-4, QueryCode can provide context-aware code assistance, making it a powerful tool for software development.

## Features
Code Exploration: GPT-4 can fetch the source code of functions, classes, and methods in your codebase. This allows GPT-4 to understand the structure and functionality of your code, providing more accurate and context-aware code assistance.

## Debugging
GPT-4 can help you understand and fix bugs in your code by getting information about errors and exceptions in your code.

## Memory
GPT-4 can store and retrieve important information about your codebase. This allows GPT-4 to remember key details or summaries about your code, providing long-term understanding of your codebase.

## Code Modification (In Development)
In the future, GPT-4 will be able to generate new code or refactor existing code, and then apply these changes directly to your codebase using the QueryCode.

## Integration with GPT-4
GPT-4 can leverage QueryCode to provide context-aware code assistance. By fetching and understanding your local codebase, GPT-4 can provide more accurate code suggestions and help you debug errors. The memory feature allows GPT-4 to build a long-term understanding of your codebase, making it a powerful tool for maintaining and improving your code over time.
